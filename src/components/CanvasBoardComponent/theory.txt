getting reference for canvas with typescript to be used with useRef hook:
const canvasRef = useRef<HTMLCanvasElement | null>(null);
const canvasCtx = canvasRef.current.getContext("2d");

pure js version of getting context would be:
const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
const canvasCtx = canvas.getContext('2d');

width and height are refered with -20 because it goes out of box on right and bottom
